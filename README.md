# Project-2
This is the second project in our bootcamp. In this project, we created an application that allows users to track their expenses.

## User Stories
* As a user who wants to manage my finances, I want to be able to track my income, expenses, and budget on a website so that I can easily compare my spending habits and income to make better financial decisions.

### Acceptance Criteria:

* GIVEN an expense tracker application
* WHEN I log into the platform or wish to create an account
* THEN I am directed to the dashboard where they can connect their bank account.
* WHEN I navigate to the `Planner` page,
* THEN I am able to plan a budget for the future.
