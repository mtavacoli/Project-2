# Project-2

## Expense Tracker

This is the second project in our bootcamp. In this project, we created an application that allows users to track their expenses.


 ## Description 

- This project was designed as a homework assignment for KU coding bootcamp in Module 15-16 Challenge, Interactive Full-Stack Project.

- This is the second project in our bootcamp. In this project, we created an application that allows users to track their expenses.

- This Project play a key role in our journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As we enter the last phase of the bootcamp, we’ll begin to apply for development jobs. If we want to land succesful interviews, our portfolio must feature high-quality deployed examples of our work—and we can use our finished projects for that very purpose.

- This is our first opportunity to show employers our collaborative skills and coding abilities, this particular project will be a focal point of our portfolio. 

- Employers want to see what we can do, but they also want to see how we work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work we have in our portfolio, the more likely we are to get an interview and a job. That’s why one of the requirements for this project is that we add it to our portfolio.

- Testing is key to making code maintainable, you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.

- A major aspect of this challenge was the balance between figuring out which solution made sense and the solution that would be most efficient.

- Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.



## Project Requirements


You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six weeks to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

* Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.

* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).


* Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.

 ## Installation

  -  There is no starter code for this assignment.

  - npm install chart.js --save

  - In order to install inquirer, i used npm i inquirer@8.2.4.

  - The application will be invoked by using the following command: 'npm start'


## Usage

  - This Challenge will combine many of the skills you’ve learned over the last week of this course. To help you get started, we’ve provided some guidelines in addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria.

  - The application should have a db.json file on the back end that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the fs module.

  - Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

  - Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.

  - Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

  - Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

  - Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

  - Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.

  - Have a polished UI.

  - Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

  - Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

  
      

## User Story


* As a user who wants to manage my finances,
*I want to be able to track my income, expenses, and budget on a website so that,
*I can easily compare my spending habits and income to make better financial decisions.


## Acceptance Criteria


* GIVEN an expense tracker application
* WHEN I log into the platform or wish to create an account
* THEN I am directed to the dashboard where they can connect their bank account.
* WHEN I navigate to the `Planner` page,
* THEN I am able to plan a budget for the future


## Tests

- Insomnia provides a way to test your APIs, all within the Test tab in Documents. Organize multiple tests under test suites and run them all at once. Unit tests in Insomnia rely on the Mocha framework, and Chai for assertions.

- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

## Summary

Presentation Requirements:

- Use this Project Presentation TemplateLinks to an external site. to address the following:

- Elevator pitch: A one-minute description of your application.

- Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

- Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

- Demo: Show your stuff!
